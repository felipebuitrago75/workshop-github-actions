## What is GitHub Actions?

_GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production._

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes.
